# Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) Optimization

Repository for the Operations Research 2 project regarding the TSP optimization, UniPD 2022/23.

The goal of the project is to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem with different approaches such as constructive heuristics, refinement heuristics, metaheuristics, exact methods, matheuristics ...

## Requirements

* [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/):  a portable command-line driven graphing utility
* [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/it-it/analytics/cplex-optimizer): IBM CPLEX Optimizer
* [Concorde](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde/index.html): TSP solver

## Installation

* Create the *build* directory using `mkdir build`
* Navigate into the *build* directory with `cd build`
* Run the command `cmake ..` to configure the project
* Execute the `make` command to build the project

## Usage

Input data are in `.tsp` from [TSPLIB](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/). Some of them are already stored in the `data` directory.

Run the main program with the following command and set the desired parameters:

```
./main -file <filepath> -solver <solver> -time_limit <tl> -seed <s> -verbose <v>
```

Example: solve the TSP regarding the **att48** instance stored in the `../data/att48.tsp` file with the greedy algorithm, running the command:

```
./main -file ../data/att48.tsp -solver GREEDY -time_limit 60 -seed 10 -verbose 10
```

To list all the parameters and solvers available run ```./main -help``` or ```./main --help```

To create a random testbed run ```./main -testbed <num_instances> <num_points>``` where *num_instances* is the number of TSP instances to be generated and *num_points* the size of each instance.
